==================

Our design guidelines in code.


### Installation

Run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BMJ-Ltd/living-style-guide
cd living-style-guide
npm install
bower install
```

If you don't have [Bower](http://bower.io/) installed, install it using:

```sh
npm install -g bower
```

### Usage

From the `living-style-guide` directory run:

```sh
gulp
```

This will build the project to the `dist` sub-directory, and then watch for changes made to the contents of `src` and automatically rebuild `dist`.
