                    <h3>What is a tone of voice?</h3>
                    <p>A tone of voice is the personality of a brand. It works alongside a company’s visual identity. It also helps to define a company and bring its brand values to life. BMJ’s tone of voice needs to be consistent to be recognisable.</p>
                    <h3>Why is tone of voice guidance important?</h3>
                    <p>Guidance helps to inform all of a company’s written copy. By following the principles in this guide, you can make your content more accessible, succinct and direct for your reader.</p>
                  </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">

              <h3>Why do we need one?</h3>
              <h4>It’s an expression of who we are</h4>
              <p>As a company, we have worked hard to establish what we do. Who we are is embodied by our brand personality and values, and drive how we interact with the medical community.</p>
              <h4>It builds trust</h4>
              <p>Our reputation is built on trust, credibility and transparency. How we communicate enforces this trust.</p>
              <h4>It connects us better with our readers</h4>
              <p>We know a lot about our customers: who they are and what their needs are.They don’t have time to shift through the plethora of information they currently receive. By following the principles in this guide, you can make your content more accessible, succinct and direct for your audience.</p>

              <h3>Our tone of voice defined</h3>
              <p>Our brand’s four most powerful personality traits have steered the thinking behind the company’s tone of voice.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                  <h4 class="pink">Confident</h4> 
                  <p>We believe in ourselves as pioneering experts within our profession. Evidence matters to us so, wherever possible, we use data to back-up our claims</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                  <h4 class="pink">Empowering</h4>
                  <p>We motivate, support and enable healthcare professionals in all communities worldwide—so the words we choose to use are clear and accessible for everyone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                  <h4 class="pink">Succinct</h4>
                  <p>We know our users and customers are busy so we speak briefly, directly and clearly. We tell them what they need to know within the first two sentences.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                  <h4 class="pink">Trustworthy</h4>
                  <p>We are honest, authentic and credible. We know who we are writing for and meet our audience’s specific needs with thoughtful, relevant information that is correct in every detail.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Our words will best engage people when they stimulate both an emotional and an intellectual response. For us, emotional language alone would be too flighty, undermining our trustworthy credibility. Using only intellectual language would be too dry and potentially pompous – alienating audiences such as medical students and clinical managers.</p>
            <p>Take a look at this formality scale and note where we sit in relation to other companies - do you agree?:</p>

            <h2>Write powerfully</h2>
            <h3>Basics for better writing</h3>  
            <p>Write first, refine later. It is easiest if you get down what you want to say, then fine-tune it.</p>

            <h4>1. Be specific and use facts</h4> 
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>Don’t use ‘corporate speak’, clichés and generic terms. Facts, figures and quotes will ground your statements in reality.</p>
                <p>Accredit sources to give your writing more credibility. To be credible, customer testimonials should not be more than 3 years old.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                <div class="highlight-box highlight-box-incorrect">
                  <p><strong>Instead of saying:</strong></p>
                  <p>BMJ OnExamination users will have a better chance of passing their exams.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <div class="highlight-box highlight-box-correct">
                    <p><strong>Say:</strong></p>
                    <p>With more than 60,000 students taking their MRCP exams each year, we make it our business to prime students to get the best possible results.</p>

              </div>

            <h4>2. Be direct, use <i>you</i></h4>

              <div class="col-sm-4">                  
                    <p>Talk directly to your reader in the active voice. Saying <i>‘you will/your users’</i> not <i>‘users will’</i> helps readers connect with your words and be active participants.</p>
                    <p>When talking or writing as the voice of the company, always refer to BMJ as we, us or our.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-4">

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>Readers tend to scan pages How you structure your writing will determine whether anyone will read it.</p>
            <h4>1. Be upfront</h4>
            <p>Structure your content so that the most relevant facts and statements are in the first paragraph. It’ll draw your reader in and compel them to read on. Focus on the clear flow of ideas to make your words count. Introductions should be about 20–30 words, summarising the page content and highlighting key themes or most interesting facts.</p>

            <p>Specifically for online content, the opening paragraph of every web page is a summary of the page. This helps visitors gain a quick understanding of the page content and its relevance to them.</p>
            <p>Keep your headlines around 6 words or less. Try to keep your main body of content around 300–400 words or less: if you have more to say, break it up into easy-to-navigate chunks.</p><br/>

            <h4>2. Use actionable subject lines for emails and use informative subheadings</h4>
            <p>Subject lines that begin with action verbs will entice your reader. Make your emails more clickable by adding a vibrant verb at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Within the email or body copy of a print advert or webpage, subheadings break your text into manageable chunks. This will catch your readers’ attention and make the page easier to navigate or scan.</p>
            <p>Specifically for web content. Structuring your writing this way will advertise your content to both visitors and search engines.</p><br/>

            <h4>3. Accentuate key points</h4>
            <p>Use bullet points, tables, graphics or boxes to gather important information in one place. Start bullet points with a verb if possible, to inspire action and empower the readers.</p><br/>

            <h4>4. Call to action</h4>
            <p>Does your content have a purpose? A call to action (CTA) asks visitors to do something. What is your call to action? No content should be without a call to action.</p>
